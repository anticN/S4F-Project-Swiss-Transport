# Swiss Public Transport

## Author
Nikola Antic

## About
This project was a part of the course "Script 4 fun" at our school. I made this App with React.<br>
The app allows you to check the departure times of the public transport in Switzerland. It shows you all departures from a specific station and you can also search for a connection between two stations. 

## API
The API I used is the [Transport API](https://transport.opendata.ch/).<br>

## Deployment 
The app is deployed on [Netlify](https://swiss-public-transport.netlify.app/).

## Note
Some features aren't finished yet, but I will continue working on them.
